##Configure Kubernetes##

The kubernetes package provides several services

* kube-apiserver
* kube-scheduler
* kube-controller-manager
* kubelet, kube-proxy

These services are managed by systemd and the configuration resides in a central location, `/etc/kubernetes`. We will break the services up between the hosts.  The first host, *master*, will be the kubernetes master.  This host will run _kube-apiserver_, _kube-controller-manager_, and _kube-scheduler_. In addition, the master will also run _etcd_. The remaining hosts, known as *nodes*, will run _kubelet_, _kube-proxy_, and _docker_.

###Prepare the hosts

* Backup the kubernetes configuration files on each system (master and nodes) before continuing.

```bash
for i in $(ls /etc/kubernetes/*); do cp $i{,.orig}; echo "Making a backup of $i"; done
```

**NOTE:** It is important that you replace any existing content in the config files below with the new content provided.  You will find that the existing content in the config files may not match what is provided below.  This is expected.

* Edit `/etc/kubernetes/config` to be the same on **all hosts**. For OpenStack VMs we will be using the *private IP address* of the master host.  Make sure to substitute out the MASTER_PRIV_IP_ADDR placeholder below.

```
# logging to stderr means we get it in the systemd journal
KUBE_LOGTOSTDERR="--logtostderr=true"

# journal message level, 0 is debug
KUBE_LOG_LEVEL="--v=0"

# Should this cluster be allowed to run privileged docker containers
KUBE_ALLOW_PRIV="--allow_privileged=false"

# How the replication controller and scheduler find the apiserver
KUBE_MASTER="--master=http://MASTER_PRIV_IP_ADDR:8080"
```

####Configure the kubernetes services on the master

* Edit `/etc/kubernetes/apiserver` to appear as such.  Make sure to substitute out the MASTER_PRIV_IP_ADDR placeholder below.  The portal_net IP addresses need to be an IP address range not used anywhere else.  They do not need to be routed.  They do not need to be assigned to anything.  It just must be an unused block of addresses.  Kubernetes will assign "services" one of these addresses.  But traffic to (or from) these addresses will NEVER leave a node.  It's actually the proxy on the local node that reponds to these addresses.  This must be a different unused range than that assigned to flannel.  Flannel specifies the addresses used by pods.  portal_net specifies the addresses used by services.  But in both cases, no infrastructure changes are needed.  Just pick an unused block of addresses.

```
# Comma separated list of nodes in the etcd cluster
KUBE_ETCD_SERVERS="--etcd_servers=http://MASTER_PRIV_IP_ADDR:4001"

# The address on the local server to listen to.
KUBE_API_ADDRESS="--address=0.0.0.0"

# Address range to use for services
KUBE_SERVICE_ADDRESSES="--portal_net=10.254.0.0/16"

# Add your own!
KUBE_API_ARGS=""
```

* Edit `/etc/kubernetes/controller-manager` to appear as such.  Substitute your node IPs here in place of the NODE_PRIV_IP_{1,2} placeholder.

```
# Comma separated list of minions
KUBELET_ADDRESSES="--machines=NODE_PRIV_IP_1,NODE_PRIV_IP_2"
```

* Start the appropriate services on master:

```bash
for SERVICE in etcd kube-apiserver kube-controller-manager kube-scheduler; do
    systemctl restart $SERVICE
    systemctl enable  $SERVICE
    systemctl status  $SERVICE
done
```

####Configure the kubernetes services on the nodes

**NOTE:** Make these changes on each node.

***We need to configure and start the kubelet and proxy***

**UGLY** Due to a bug in kubernetes we must configure an empty JSON authorization file on each node.
* Create the JSON file by running the following on all nodes

```bash
echo "{}" > /var/lib/kubelet/auth
```

* Edit `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet` to appear as below.  Make sure you substitute kublet or node IP addresses appropriately. You have to make two changes below.

```
# The address for the info server to serve on
KUBELET_ADDRESS="--address=0.0.0.0"

# this MUST match what you used in KUBELET_ADDRESSES on the controller manager
# unless you used what hostname -f shows in KUBELET_ADDRESSES.
KUBELET_HOSTNAME="--hostname_override=LOCAL_NODE_ETH0_ADDRESS"

KUBELET_API_SERVER="--api_servers=http://MASTER_PRIV_IP_ADDR:8080"

# Add your own!
KUBELET_ARGS="--auth_path=/var/lib/kubelet/auth"
```

* edit `/etc/kubernetes/proxy` to appear as below.

```
# How the proxy finds the apiserver
KUBE_PROXY_ARGS="--master=http://MASTER_PRIV_IP_ADDR:8080"
```

* Start the appropriate services on the nodes.

```bash
for SERVICE in kube-proxy kubelet docker; do
    systemctl restart $SERVICE
    systemctl enable  $SERVICE
    systemctl status  $SERVICE
done
```

*You should be finished!*

* Check to make sure the cluster can see the nodes from the master.

```
$ kubectl get nodes
NAME              LABELS    STATUS
192.168.121.147   <none>    Ready
192.168.121.101   <none>    Ready
```

**The cluster should be running! Launch a test pod.**

##Deploy an application##


* Create a file on master named `apache.json` that looks as such:

```json
{
    "apiVersion": "v1beta3",
    "kind": "Pod",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "apache-pod",
        "namespace": "default",
        "labels": {
            "name": "apache"
        }
    },
    "spec": {
        "containers": [
            {
                "name": "fedora-apache-container",
                "image": "fedora/apache",
                "ports": [
                    {
                        "containerPort": 80,
                        "protocol": "TCP"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "restartPolicy": "Always",
        "volumes": [

        ]
    }
}
```

This JSON file is describing the attributes of the application environment. For example, it is giving the pod a "name" and "labels", the container a "name" and "ports", and specifying the "image" to use for creating the container. Since the fedora/apache image doesn't exist in our environment yet, it will be pulled down automatically as part of the deployment process.

For more information about which options can go in the schema, check out the docs on the [kubernetes github page](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/tree/master/docs).

* Deploy the fedora/apache image via the `apache.json` file.

```
kubectl create -f apache.json
```


* This command exits immediately, returning the name of the pod, `apache-pod`. You can monitor progress of the operations with these commands:
On the master (master) -

```
journalctl -f -l -xn -u kube-apiserver -u kube-scheduler
```

* On the node -

```
journalctl -f -l -xn -u kubelet -u kube-proxy -u docker
```


* After the pod is deployed, you can also list the pod.  I have a few pods running here.

```
# kubectl get pods
POD           IP         CONTAINER(S)             IMAGE(S)            HOST            LABELS             STATUS
apache-pod    18.0.53.3                                             192.168.121.147/  name=apache        Running
                         fedora-apache-container  fedora/apache                                          Running
mysql-pod     18.0.73.2                                             192.168.121.101/  name=mysql         Running
                         mysql-container          mysql                                                  Running
redis-master  18.0.53.2                                             192.168.121.147/  name=redis-master  Running
                         master                   dockerfile/redis                                       Running
```

The status might be 'Pending'. This indicates that docker is still attempting to download and launch the container.

* You can get even more information about the pod like this.

```
kubectl get pods --output=json apache-pod
```

* Finally, on the node, check that the pod is available and running.

```

```

## Create a service to make the pod discoverable ##

Now that the pod is known to be running we need a way to find it.  Pods in
kubernetes may launch on any node and get an IP addresses from flannel.  So
finding them is obviously not easy.  You don't want people to have to look up
what node the web server is on before they can find your web page!  Kubernetes
solves this with a "service".  By default kubernetes will create an internal IP
address for the service (from the portal_net range) which pods can use to find
the service.  But we want the web server to be available outside the cluster.
So we need to tell kubernetes how traffic will arrive into the cluster destined
for this webserver.  To do so we provide a list of "publicIPs".  These need to
be actual IP addresses assigned to actual nodes.  In configurations like AWS or
OpenStack where machines have both a public IP assigned somewhere "in the
cloud" and the private IP assigned to the node, you must use the private IP.
This IP must be assigned to a node and be visible on the node via "ip addr."
This is a list, so you may list multiple nodes' public IPs.

* Create a service on the master by creating a `service.json` file

**NOTE:** You must use an actual IP address for the `publicIPs` value or the service will not run correctly on the nodes

```json
{
    "apiVersion": "v1beta3",
    "kind": "Service",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "frontend-service",
        "namespace": "default",
        "labels": {
            "name": "frontend"
        }
    },
    "spec": {
        "selector": {
            "name": "apache"
        },
        "ports": [
            {
                "protocol": "TCP",
                "port": 80
            }
        ],
        "publicIPs": [
            "NODE_PRIV_IP_1"
        ]
    }
}
```

* Load the JSON file into the kubenetes system

```bash
kubectl create -f service.json
```

* Check that the service is loaded on the master

```bash
# kubectl get services
NAME              LABELS                                   SELECTOR     IP              PORT
kubernetes-ro     component=apiserver,provider=kubernetes  <none>       10.254.207.162  80
frontend-service  name=frontend                            name=apache  10.254.195.231  80
kubernetes        component=apiserver,provider=kubernetes  <none>       10.254.8.30     443
```

* Check out how proxying is done by running the following commands on any node.

```bash
iptables -nvL -t nat
journalctl -b -l -u kube-proxy
```

* Finally, test that the container is actually working.

```
curl http://NODE_PRIV_IP_1/
Apache
```

* Now really test it.  If you are using OS1 you should be able to hit the web server from you web browser by going to the PUBLIC IP associated with the node(s) you chose in your service.

```
firefox http://NODE_PUBLIC_IP_1/
```

* To delete the container.

```
kubectl delete pod apache-pod
```

## Create a replication controller to control the pod ##

This should have the exact same definition of the pod as above, only now it is being controlled by a replication controller.  So if you delete the pod, or if the node disappears, the pod will be restarted elsewhere in the cluster!

* Create an `rc.json` file to describe the replication controller

```json
{
    "apiVersion": "v1beta3",
    "kind": "ReplicationController",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "apache-controller",
        "namespace": "default",
        "labels": {
            "name": "apache"
        }
    },
    "spec": {
        "replicas": 1,
        "selector": {
            "name": "apache"
        },
        "template": {
            "metadata": {
                "labels": {
                    "name": "apache"
                }
            },
            "spec": {
                "containers": [
                    {
                        "name": "fedora-apache-container",
                        "image": "fedora/apache",
                        "ports": [
                            {
                                "containerPort": 80,
                                "protocol": "TCP"
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                ],
                "restartPolicy": "Always",
                "volumes": [

                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

* Load the JSON file on the master

```bash
kubectl create -f rc.json
```
* Check that the replication controller has started

```bash
# kubectl get rc
CONTROLLER         CONTAINER(S)             IMAGE(S)       SELECTOR     REPLICAS
apache-controller  fedora-apache-container  fedora/apache  name=apache  1
```

* The replication controller should have spawned a pod on a node.  (This make take a short while, so STATUS may be Unknown at first)

```bash
# kubectl get pods
POD                                   IP         CONTAINER(S)             IMAGE(S)       HOST         LABELS       STATUS
52228aef-be99-11e4-91e5-52540052bd24  18.0.79.4  fedora-apache-container  fedora/apache  kube-node1/  name=apache  Running
```

Feel free to resize the replication controller and run multiple copies of apache.  Note that the kubernetes `publicIP` balances between ALL of the replicas!

```bash
# kubectl resize --replicas=3 replicationController apache-controller
resized

# kubectl get rc
CONTROLLER         CONTAINER(S)             IMAGE(S)       SELECTOR     REPLICAS
apache-controller  fedora-apache-container  fedora/apache  name=apache  3

# kubectl get pods
POD                                   IP         CONTAINER(S)             IMAGE(S)       HOST         LABELS       STATUS
ac23ccfa-be99-11e4-91e5-52540052bd24  18.0.98.3  fedora-apache-container  fedora/apache  kube-node2/  name=apache  Running
52228aef-be99-11e4-91e5-52540052bd24  18.0.79.4  fedora-apache-container  fedora/apache  kube-node1/  name=apache  Running
ac22a801-be99-11e4-91e5-52540052bd24  18.0.98.2  fedora-apache-container  fedora/apache  kube-node2/  name=apache  Running
```

I suggest you resize to 0 before you delete the replication controller.  Deleting a `replicationController` will leave the pods running.

Of course this just scratches the surface. I recommend you head off to the kubernetes github page and follow the [guestbook example](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/tree/754a2a8305c812121c3845d8293efdd819b6a704/examples/guestbook-go). It is a bit more complicated but should expose you to more functionality.
